Description: Tools are provided to streamline Bayesian analyses in 'JAGS' using 
    the 'jagsUI' package.  Included are functions for extracting output in 
    simpler format, functions for streamlining assessment of convergence, and 
    functions for producing summary plots of output.  Also included is a 
    function that provides a simple template for running 'JAGS' from 'R'.
